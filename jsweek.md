### Learn JavaScript in a week PDF.
### What is JavaScript?

```md
Javascript is a programming language which is used to develop dynamic web and mobile applications.By using javascript we can manipulate the DOM.(Add,Update,Delete).And also by using javascript we can perfom validations.
DOM:Document object model.
```
### What is ES6?
```md
ES6
ES6 stands for Ecma script.
```
### What is Node Js.
```md
Node js.
Node js is a runtime environament for javascript,By using nodejs we can create API's.
Node js is not a programing language not a libraary and neighter a framework.
```

### Set up development Environment.

To set up the Dev environment for the front end we need a browser.
```md
To start things off with the setup we need a browser.
It could be any browser(Chrome,edge,Arc,Mozilla Firefox...Etc...)
We need an IDE(Integrated development environment)
1.VS code
2.SublimeText.
3.Atom and a few others.
We recommend SublimeText!
```

```md
We need a HTMl file to run JavaScript code in the frontend.
To create a HTML file all you got to do is,
Open up your IDE and save the files with a .HTML extension.
Example : index.html
And then you are good to go.
```

```md
### To run a JavaScript file.
To run Javascript in it save another file with a .js extension.
Example: index.js
Same as the .html file above mentioned.
```

```md
Next you need to attach the .js file to the html file.
For this you need to open up your index.html file in the Ide(Sublime,Vscode or....anyother IDE).
As you can see the below html code there you need to type in this code.

<script src="index.js"> </script>
<script> : This is a HTML script tag.
Using this tag you will be able to attach the .Js file.
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<title> How to attach a .js file to a html file </title>
<script src="index.js> </script>
<head>

<body>

</body>

</head>

</html>

```

```.md
### To attch a css file, you need to repeat the same thing but...with
the <link> tag.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css> 
Just like the HTML and Js file, you need to name the css file with a .css Extension.Yes that's how computers work!
Pretty Cool right???
Never mind.
```

```.md
So, Enough going off script..
We will start JavaScript now.
javascript is a programming language.......Blah Blah blah..
So far we know these things.
```

### Here's the main part of the JavaScript.
```.md
We can store data in memory by using these keywords.
By using these data types we store the variables.
1.var
2.let
3.const
```

```js
//Example
let mango = 100;
var apple = 200;
const banana = 300;
```

```js
//To print the values in JavaScript we need to console.log.
console.log();
//This is the syntax for printing the values in javascript.
```

### Example.
```js
let mango = 50;
console.log(mango)
//Output : 50
```
##### Get it?
```.md
(;) is optional by the way.
```

### What's Next??
### Data Types.
```.md
Data types :
There are two types of data types in JavaScript.
1.Primitive data types and non primitive....(nah)
2.Refrence data types.
```

We use ==primitive data types== to store a single value in a memory.
We use ===Reference data types== to store multiple values in the memory

### primitive data types.
```md
- String
- number
- Boolean
- undefined
- null
```

```.md
String data types..
A string is a collection of characteres that is stored in a memory.
By using "",'',``
We can store strings in the memory.
```

```js
//Example:
let stream1 = "netflix"; //using double quotes.
let stream2 = 'amazon'; //Using singe quotes.
let stream3  = `hulu`; //Using (``) (What ever these are) 
//Kidding these are called backticks.
```

```md
Number data types.
we can use a integers or floats using number data type.
```

```js
let num1 = 1000;
let num2 = 0.0555; //this is a float number.
```

```md
Boolean.
We can store boolean data types,
true or false using boolean data types.
```
```js
var bool1= true;
var bool2 = false;
```


"this is hemanth kumar"
"this is another one and it is just a test like the other ones and it is just github"
```js

console.log("Here i come and i am comming to save the git hub people")



```
