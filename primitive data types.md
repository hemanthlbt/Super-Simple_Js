```js
//I have a small question and dbout..!!
let string = "hemanth"
string[0] = "B"
console.log(string)

//what will be the output????
```

```md
The out put would be hemanth..
same as the given string.It wont change this thing because, In javascript the primitive data types are immutable so you cant change these types.
